## {{page.title}}

Let's thank Floor Drees for organizing and teaching Ruby to girls and boys.

Floor Drees - a transplant from the Netherlands (Rotterdam) - started the Vienna.rb meetup in Austria's capital city two years ago
and the meetup celebrates this month the twenty-first get-together reaching three-hundred Rubyists.

Floor has (co-)organized or coached at more than a dozen Rails Girls workshops around Europe
helping aspiring lady techies build the first ever web application in Ruby - including:

- Rails Girls Amsterdam
- Rails Girls Eindhoven
- Rails Girls Rotterdam
- Rails Girls The Hague
- Rails Girls Leiden
- Rails Girls Linz
- Rails Girls Maribor
- Rails Girls Brno
- Rails Girls Bratislava
- Rails Girls Baku
- Rails Girls Eurucamp

Floor helped kickstart the Rails Girls Summer of Code programm organizing and raising $93.000 in funds
to support thirty-two students (ten sponsored teams plus six volunteer teams) in the 2014 edition.

When not organizing Ruby events, Floor organizes - surprise, surprise - Python events and started
the PyLadies chapter in Vienna among others.


## About Floor Drees

Who's the Rails girl with the "If anyone ever tells you you put too much Parmesan cheese on you pasta,
stop talking to them. You donâ€™t need that kind of negativity in your life." quote on the blog?

Floor Drees studied Graphics Design at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam
and now lives in Vienna - Austria's capital city in Central Europe -
and likes non-metaphorical bridges and wants to become Neelie Kroes when grown up.
