## {{page.title}}

Let's thank Ryan Davis for polishing Ruby since 2000.
Ryan's RubyGems page lists eighty-three gems with a total of fifty-two million downloads - including gems such as:

**minitest** -  a complete suite of testing goodies
supporting test-driven development (TDD),  behaviour-driven development (BDD), mocking, and benchmarking.

**hoe** -  a rake task suite helping you manage, maintain, and release
your projects; includes a dynamic plug-in system allowing for easy extensibility.
Hoe ships with plug-ins for all your usual project tasks including rdoc generation,
testing, packaging, publishing, and announcement.

**ruby_parser** - a ruby parser written in pure ruby (using ruby yacc - racc).
ruby_parser's output is the same as parsetree's output, that is, s-expressions using ruby's arrays and base types.
Tested against 801,039 files from the latest of all rubygems.

And many many more gems (e.g. open4, sexp_processor, ruby2ruby, zentest, flog, flay, autotest, rubyinline,
racc, parsetree, vlad, isolate, zenweb, and on and on).

Ryan also writes the all-in-one-page Ruby Quick Reference covering the
Ruby Language, the Standard Library and the Tools.


## About Ryan Davis

Who's the guy who likes to write code with the "More matter, with less art"  Gertrude quote from
Hamlet on the blog?

Ryan is an Evergreener and studied and majored
in computer science at the Evergreen State College (TESC)
in Olympia, Washington in the Pacific Northwest.

Ryan started using Ruby in 2000 after taking a workshop from
Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas at the Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)
conference - pretty much the same day the Programming Ruby ("Pickaxe") book launched.

Since then, Ryan helped start the worldâ€™s first Ruby Brigade in Seattle [1]
and has written or contributed to over a hundred ruby projects. 
Additionally, Ryan's a loving cat foster parent, a culinary enthusiast,
and a proud geoduck.

Q: What's the story with the zenspider handle?
