What's `sportweb`?

It's the `sport.db.admin` web app bundled up 
into an easy-to-use command line tool, that is,
`sportweb` for (local) use on your own machine.
Let's say you have an SQLite database - e.g. `football.db` - in your folder,
than just type

```
$ sportweb
```

and that's it - open your browser (e.g. use `localhost:3000`)
and start browsing your local SQLite sports database.
