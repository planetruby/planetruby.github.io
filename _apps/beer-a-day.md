What's the Beer-A-Day Calendar?

The beer-a-day calendar web app in Ruby on Rails serves up
a different beer (and brewery) every day (w/ web feed)
using the `beer.db` - open public domain beer, brewpub and brewery data.

See live demos with an [all-Austrian](http://at365.herokuapp.com)
or an [all-Belgian](http://be365.herokuapp.com) taproom
online or do-it-yourself and build your own calendar to your taste.
All code and data is public domain. Cheers. Prost. Kampai
